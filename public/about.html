<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>"Keep learning something new, every day!"</p>
<p> Whatever coincidence brought you to my project portfolio,
  it's nice to have you here. This is my personal playground for all of the small (or big) projects 
  I work on while learning web development and more. Look around, and maybe you can see my 
  learning progress. </p>
<p>Special thanks to Angela Yu for her course in web development, 
  which is the main source of most of the knowledge you can find here.</p>
